# Web-page-downloader
A web page downloader. Requires the wget command found in \*nix operating systems. 
This program uses the ANSI C 99 libraries (The standard libraries, no weird dependencies needed)

Tested in Ubuntu MATE 18.04 with GCC 7.4.0. Working

# WARNINGS
   
  There is a bug with the scanf function in C and GCC (IDE users won't have this issue) that makes you introduce the URL twice.               
  Press enter and then introduce the URL.

  If you want it to work on Windows NT, grab a copy of wget.exe (https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/). 
  Also, in Windows, when I tried to test the program, the antivirus thought that it was a virus(it's not). Any Issues related to anomalies with the antivirus won't be answered.
# Compilation
Use gcc or import it to your favorite IDE.
