# Web-page-downloader
A web page downloader. Requires the wget command found in \*nix operating systems. 
This program uses the ANSI C 99 libraries (The standard libraries, no weird dependencies needed)

Tested in Ubuntu MATE 18.04 with GCC 7.4.0. Working

# WARNINGS

  If you want it to work on Windows NT, grab a copy of wget.exe (https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/). 
  Also, in Windows, when I tried to test the program, the antivirus thought that it was a virus(it's not). Any Issues related to anomalies with the antivirus won't be answered.
# Compilation
Pretty straightforward: run `make`.
