WARNINGS
  This is recommended to use with internet (for viewing the pages) because there are some web pages that just work online.
  
  There is a bug with the scanf function in C and GCC (IDE users won't have this issue) that makes you introduce the URL twice.               
  Press enter and then introduce the URL.
