# Web-page-downloader
A web page downloader. Uses the wget command found in \*nix operating systems. 
This program uses the ANSI C 99 libraries (The default ones)

Tested in Ubuntu MATE 18.04 with GCC 7.4.0 *Passes*

# WARNINGS
  This is recommended to use with internet (to view the pages) because there are some web pages that can't work offline. (for example: images aren't downloaded) 
  
  There is a bug with the scanf function in C and GCC (IDE users won't have this issue) that makes you introduce the URL twice.               
  Press enter and then introduce the URL.

  If you want it to work on Windows NT, grab a copy of wget.exe (https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/) 
# Compilation
Use gcc or import it to your favorite IDE.
